**Title of Project:** **Empowering Traditional Medicine: Cutting-Edge AI for Indian Medicinal Leaf Recognition**

**Team Members:**
1. Deepanshu Prajapati
2. Garvit Agarwal
3. Deepanshu Prajapati

**Steps for Execution:**

_1. Dataset Collection & Curation_
   - Captured and labeled Indian medicinal leaf images.
   - Created a dataset of at least 10 images per class for initial model training.

_2. Model Development_
   - Trained two deep learning models: MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetV2 using CNN-based architecture.
   - Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, and inference speed.

_3. Backend Development_
   - Built an API using FastAPI to handle image classification requests.
   - Integrated both models with endpoints that allow selection between MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetV2.

_4. Frontend Development_
   - Developed the user interface using ReactJS.
   - Users can upload leaf images and receive instant identification with Ayurvedic medicinal details.

_5. Database Integration_
   - Used MongoDB to store plant data, descriptions, and associated Ayurvedic uses.

_6. AI Chatbot Integration_
   - Integrated Gemini API to provide a conversational AI chatbot for queries related to medicinal plants.

_7. Testing & Validation_
   - Conducted functional testing of all features.
   - Validated model predictions with domain experts when available.

_8. Deployment_
   - Containerized the backend with a Dockerfile for scalable deployment.
   - Ensured cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness of the frontend.
